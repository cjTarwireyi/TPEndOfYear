#OVERVIEW 
Nawaal Cottle has a small business which she runs at home she buys and sells clothing,perfume,jewellery etc.He business is based in a rural area where people can really buy this<br/>
So she decided to start up a business where CLIENTS CAN BUY PRODUCTS which there will recieve on the spot BUT THEY WILL ONLY PAY FOR IT AT THE END OF THE MONTH FOR A THAN STORE PRICE<br/>
She will be able to create orders,add products and very importantly track her stock as she sells product<br/>

#WHY IS THIS UNQIUE
We have discoverd that there are MANY small businesses like this in rural area but no system has been designed for this type of business yet, she this a good to create something that has not been created yet<br>

#PURPOSE
This system is designed to keep track of all orders purchased by clients over various months and years<br/>
It will enable the owner to see which products sells and does not sell well<br/>
It will also allow the owner to see who the good customers and bad customers are<br/>
Keeping track of stock will be so much easier<br/>
